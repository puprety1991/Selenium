Locators:
Xpath:
1.  Absolute
2.  Relative

Absolute Xpath:
        Starts with starting node html and then you proceed in the hierarchy.
Reason not used often:
1. too long, complicated
2. If there is any addition in the hierarchy there is a possibility that the path is not valid any more.

Relative Xpath:
Syntax:
//tagName[@attribute='attribute value']
get me the 'tagName' which has an 'attribute' whose value is 'attribute value'
<input id ="box",class="white'>box</input>
//input[@id='box']
