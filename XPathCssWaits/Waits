Thread.sleep(1000) --> static wait / unconditional wait
Types of Selenium Waits:
Implicit
Explicit
Fluent

Implicit:
Implicit wait tells your webDriver wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an "No such Element exception".
Implicit wait is written only once and will be applied for the whole session/execution.
We can say Implicit wait is also called global wait.

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your element is located in 3 seconds the rest time will be ignored.
Your script will move on to the next action. It will be applied only for findElement() or findElements() method.

Syntax: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Explicit waits or WebDriver wait:
It is used to tell webDriver to wait for a certain or expected condition before throwing "ElementNotVisibleException".
Explicit wait works with ExceptedConditional class waits until the condition is met or the given time is achieved.
