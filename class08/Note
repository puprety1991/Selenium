-------------> WAITS <-------------
 **> wait for WebElement to be found --> Implicit wait
 **> implicit wait --> global

 scenario:
    webElement : </button id = "type">button</button>
    appears in the DOM after 10 seconds

-------------> EXPLICIT WAITS <-------------
explicit wait are conditional wait
it will wait till a certain condition is fulfilled or the timeout runs out

Rough syntax:
    wait.until.webElement to be displayed()

Real syntax for explicit wait:

1. define the wait: WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,20)
2. Condition: wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeVisible(By.xpath("")));

-------------> FLUENT WAITS <-------------
The fluent wait allows us to set the polling time for the particular webElement.


-------------> REVISION <-------------
1. waits
    a. Implicit wait --> will wait until the webElement is found in the DOM
    b. Explicit wait --> it is conditional wait --> e.g. element to be visible/clickable/selected
    c. Fluent --> We can set polling time in such waits, what is pulling?--> frequency with which it checks the DOM for a webElement

Explicit wait:
    Approach:
        a. to declare the webDriver wait and set a timeouts.
        b. wait until your condition is met(for a particular webElement)
